## Description
This is a website about me, including what are my work, educational experience, and technical skills.

## Technical Details

This is a website built with [Astro](https://astro.build), which is a next-gen front-end framework that is good at building content-based websites, and capable of reducing bundle size to very small to reduce the loading time.

My website is built on this with **zero Javascript** so you can see my portfolio **blazingly fast**.
