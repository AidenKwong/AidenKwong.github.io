## Traversy Media

https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia

Traversy Media is an American YouTube channel I watch at the beginning of my programming learning journey. It provides tutorials on web development and programming. The channel was started by Brad Traversy, who started coding in 2007 at the age of 26 and became a full-time educator and content creator in 2016. The channel aims to show people that they don't have to be a straight-A student or a genius to learn to code and focuses on breaking down complex concepts by implementing them in project-based courses and tutorials.

Traversy Media offers practical project-based courses on web development that are easy to understand and straight to the point with no fluff. The courses cover topics from the building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to frontend frameworks like React and Vue, to backend technologies like Node.js, Python, and PHP.
